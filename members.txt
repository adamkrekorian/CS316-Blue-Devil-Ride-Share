FINAL SUBMISSION:

Meredith Brown -

Grace Llwellyn - 

Adam Krekorian - 

Isabel Shiff - Isabel has been present at all team meetings and attended meetings with Danai when applicable. You can see my specific contributions below. Since the last update, I finished the find rides page and had that completely functional for deploument. I helped prepare the script and final slides for the presentation/recording. I reviewed the project report. I completed all work allocated by Calleigh and did so before the deadlines that were set by the class and as a team. I think we worked well together and that we all contributed to our respective parts.

Calleigh Smith - Calleigh has acted as the group's project manager, where she has coordinated group meeting, allocated work load, and kept track of the group's progress throughout the semester. Calleigh was responsible for the database and dataset. She set up an appointment with Danai Adkisson at the Technology Engagement Center, where she was joined by Grace Llewellyn, to create a group VM which hosts the Postgres Rideshare database that has all of our project’s tables. She also simulated all of the data that resides in the database with careful attention to accuracy. Calleigh wrote the initial version of the “load.sql” file, which inserts some sample data into the Rideshare database.  Calleigh created the E/R diagram for the database design and the related associations. Calleigh was responsible for creating the Sign-Up page for new users, the Sign-Up page for drivers, the Login page, and the List Rides page. Calleigh dealt with the deployment of our website. She met with Danai Adkisson multiple times to prepare the folders and files for deployment, and when that was complete, she and Danai successfully deployed the site using a docker on the group's shared VM. Since Calleigh was responsible for setting up the database and deploying the site on the group's VM, she wrote the "readme.txt" file which explains how to access the database and deploy the website. Calleigh was in charge of updating and organizing the progress report throughout the course of the project. Calleigh created the final presentation to accompany the project demo.  As a team member, Calleigh has attended every private group meeting throughout the semester, frequently and proactively sought help from Danai Adkisson at the Technology Engagement Center, helped her teammates debug various pages of the website, and answered conceptual questions about Flask/PostgreSQL/deployment.

Adam Krekorian - Adam has attended all team meetings, met with Danai, attended office hours, and worked with the team to complete the project. I also helped with the final report and presentation. Adam worked on tasks outline by Calleigh and assisted other team members with troubleshooting when needed. Since the last update, Adam worked on implementing prepared statements in the find-rides page, the account page and the list-rides page. Meredith helped him troubleshoot issues with prepared statements. Prepared statements as a whole caused a lot of problems and required lots of troubleshooting and help from TA's. Adam also worked with Danai and Calleigh to deploy the website and understand redploy so that changes can be made after deployment.

MILESTONE 2:

Meredith Brown - Meredith helped Grace with the Accounts page to connect it to the home page and get it initially running. Additionally, she attended two meetings with Danai Adkisson, one in person and one via Zoom, to contribute to the group’s progress towards completion of MS2. After experiencing technical issues, she further emailed with Danai to get all of the group’s code running on her computer. Likewise, she attended all private group meetings to discuss progress on the project. Meredith also added additional data to the database for better testing results. Once the code for MS2 was completed, Meredith wrote a script with Adam for the 5 minute video of the website, which she then filmed and narrated. Likewise, Meredith updated the test-sample.sql statements to more accurately reflect the data in the database, and she ran these statements over the database to produce the test-sample.out file. 

Grace Llewellyn - Grace attended all meetings with the technology engagement center for help with the project and attended all course meetings. She worked on a table in models.py, tried to figure out primary and foreign keys for the table, created a reference in our shared folder to help understand python/html better, fixed syntax errors in forms.py, and worked on the home page of the website and imported the pictures. Grace also input code into the database, added the accounts page and got certain actions to work on it, fixed the links at the top bar of our website, linked the edit password/ ride pages to the account page, fixed the footer of the website, helped with various problems on the project, and reviewed all aspects of the project before submiting.

Adam Krekorian - Adam worked on the Find Rides page. Adam had issues running the website on his personal computer, so he helped Isabel work on the find-rides page via zoom, specifically the wtform information on the HTML page. This involved working in forms.py, app.py and find-rides.html. Adam met with Danai to resolve his local environment issues. Adam also wrote up the progress report for milestone 2 and wrote the script for the website voiceover. Adam attended every group meeting including the meeting with Danai, and helped troubleshoot issues when other group members needed assistance. 

Isabel Shiff - Isabel created and worked on the Find Rides page. Adam helped one time via Zoom with writing the wtform information on the HTML page. Independently, Isabel has gotten the find rides page to a place where users can search for a ride and if there are results it will show in a table on the page. This involved working in forms.py, app.py, models.py and find-rides.html. I will finish this page by allowing users to sign up for a ride after the milestone before the final presentation. I also helped add more data to the database. I have attended all group meetings. I have been able to attend one meeting with Danai where he helped with wtform validation and finding those errors. I was able to fix the list rides and find rides forms after this call.

Calleigh Smith - Calleigh was responsible for creating the Sign-Up page for new users, the Sign-Up page for drivers, the Login page, and the List Rides page. All of these pages are functional and successfully connected to the database, and besides perhaps some aesthetic changes, they are complete. Additionally, Calleigh attended every private group meeting since MS1 and every group meeting with Danai Adkisson at the Technology Engagement Center in addition to additional meetings that she and Grace coordinated for additional questions. With Danai's help, she has started working on the deployment of the website, and she has fixed bugs in various pages of the site. Additionally, she has assisted team members on their respective assignments for the milestone by helping with debugging and conceptual elements of Flask/PostgreSQL. She added more data to the PostgreSQL database for more efficient testing. She has continued her role as project manager since MS2 by delegating the workload and keeping track of the team's progress, and she feels like the group is doing an excellent job in terms of their progress.

MILESTONE 1:

Meredith Brown - Meredith met with the team to discuss ideas for the project as well as initial assignment of roles. She met with Grace Llewellyn and wrote the initial version of the “create.sql” file, which she later went back through and fixed syntax errors upon its completion. Using the “readme.txt” created by Calleigh Smith, she entered the team’s virtual machine and created the tables for the database, as well as beginning to upload functions and triggers before passing the task off to Isabel Shiff. Likewise, she met with Adam Krekorian to test the SQL queries written for Task 5, as well as produced the “test-sample.out”.

Grace Llewellyn- Grace met with the team to discussion project ideas. Grace also met with the group twice to work on creating the tables and triggers. Grace went to office hours with questions and went to the appointment with Calleigh to learn how to create the Database. Grace has helped answer questions other group members have in the group chat and coordinated with Calleigh delegating responsibilities. Grace also created the relational schema for the project and started looking for syntax errors in the create table file. Grace also looked over the final MS1 to check for any changes that should be made. 

Adam Krekorian - Adam met with the team to discuss project ideas. The group came together and decided to make a ride-sharing website to help students cut down on fossil fuel emissions and reduce the cost of long distance trips by encouraging and facilitating carpooling. Adam wrote the brief description which laid out the objective of the website. Adam also helped modify and complete the create.sql file, including many of the triggers needed. Adam wrote all the example SQL queries for dynamic content that will be displayed in the future on the website, and then met with Meredith to test the queries in the database. Adam went to Sunday office hours to clarify the format of the SQL queries and additionally clarified the structure of the relational schema in preparation for submission of milestone 1.

Isabel Shiff - Isabel met with the team to discuss project ideas and to delegate tasks. She completed the interface description with help from Adam. She helped with inital writing of triggers in the create.sql file. Isabel continued to upload the triggers and functions in the create.sql file that Meredith had not done yet. Once completing this, she inserted the sample data into the database which required modifying and reloading the majority of the triggers and some of the sample data. She created tester SQL queries to ensure that the triggers were working - they all worked, i.e. did not insert the data.

Calleigh Smith - Calleigh has created the sample data tables in Excel, created the E/R diagram for the database design and the related associations. She set up an appointment with Danai Adkisson at the Technology Engagement Center, where she was joined by Grace Llewellyn, to create a group VM which hosts the Postgres Rideshare database that has all of our project’s tables. From this meeting, Calleigh was able to write the “readme.txt” file that explains how to create and load the sample database.  Additionally, Calleigh wrote the initial version of the “load.sql” file, which inserts the sample data from Excel into the Rideshare database. Calleigh has acted as the group’s project manager, where she has coordinated group meetings, allocated work load, and kept track of the group’s progress on the milestone.
