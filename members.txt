Meredith Brown - Meredith met with the team to discuss ideas for the project as well as initial assignment of roles. She met with Grace Llewellyn and wrote the initial version of the “create.sql” file, which she later went back through and fixed syntax errors upon its completion. Using the “readme.txt” created by Calleigh Smith, she entered the team’s virtual machine and created the tables for the database, as well as beginning to upload functions and triggers before passing the task off to Isabel Shiff. Likewise, she met with Adam Krekorian to test the SQL queries written for Task 5, as well as produced the “test-sample.out”.

Calleigh Smith - Calleigh has created the sample data tables in Excel, created the E/R diagram for the database design and the related associations. She set up an appointment with Danai Adkisson at the Technology Engagement Center, where she was joined by Grace Llwellyn, to create a group VM which hosts the Postgres Rideshare database that has all of our project’s tables. From this meeting, Calleigh was able to write the “readme.txt” file that explains how to create and load the sample database.  Additionally, Calleigh wrote the initial version of the “load.sql” file, which inserts the sample data from Excel into the Rideshare database. Calleigh has acted as the group’s project manager, where she has coordinated group meetings, allocated work load, and kept track of the group’s progress on the milestone.
